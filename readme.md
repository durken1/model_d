# Model D

## Note: I got this working using a fork of QMK for XWhatsit by deskthority user pandrew. There is probably room for improvement in the PCB - the current version is basically a working prototype, so use this at your own peril. No guarantees :)

40% ortho keyboard using a capacitive pcb and Model F switches.

The ground plate is important to avoid interference and is to be placed beneath the main pcb.

## Case
I have included the STLs (cut to be printable on "normal" sized printers, I used an Ender 3 V2) for my case as well as the step file, so it should be easy to make adjustments to fit your need. 
I used M3 inserts and screws for attaching stuff (all the 4mm round holes).

The PCBs slide into the plate that is then attached to the main case using the mounting bracket. The plate is designed with 0.8 mm PCBs in mind (1.6 mm total for main + ground pcb).

I think most of the assembly is pretty straight forward, so I won't make a guide unless there is demand for one. Feel free to contact me with any questions though.

For my build I used a TH-xwhatsit and a short USB C panel mount extension cable.
