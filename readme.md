40% ortho capacitive pcb for Model F flippers

Designed to use [TH-XWhatsit](https://github.com/listofoptions/TH-XWhatsIt). The distance between row and column connections are the same to allow stacking (hence all unconnected pads)

The ground plate is important to avoid interference and is to be placed beneath the main pcb. I recommend soldering connections on the front of the main pcb and back of the ground plate to allow a flush fit.

I have included STL files for a plate that works. One complete and one half for smaller print beds (just flip it and print again).
